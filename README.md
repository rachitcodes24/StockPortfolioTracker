🚀 Built a Stock Portfolio Tracking Tool in Python for Real-Time Stock Performance Tracking 📈

I recently created a Stock Portfolio Tracking Tool in Python that allows users to add, remove, and track their stock investments. 

📝 Key Features:

Add Stocks to Portfolio: Users can add stocks to their portfolio by providing the stock symbol, the number of shares, and the purchase price.

Remove Stocks: Users can easily remove stocks from their portfolio when they are no longer part of the investment strategy.

Real-Time Stock Price Fetching: The tool fetches live stock prices using the Alpha Vantage API to show the latest value of each stock in the portfolio.

Track Performance: For each stock, the tool calculates the current value and the profit/loss in both dollar amount and percentage, helping users to track their investments' performance over time.

Overall Portfolio Summary: Displays the total value of the portfolio, the total investment made, and the overall profit/loss.

The tool uses the Alpha Vantage API to get minute-by-minute stock data. Users can track their stocks based on the latest market prices.

🔍 Main Functionalities:

Add/Remove Stocks: Users can add stocks to their portfolio by specifying the stock symbol, quantity, and purchase price, and remove stocks when needed.

Real-Time Performance Tracking: By fetching real-time prices, the tool calculates the total current value of the portfolio and compares it to the original investment to show profit/loss and percentage change.

🛠 Technologies Used:

Python: The tool was built using Python, leveraging its ease of use and flexibility.

Alpha Vantage API: For real-time stock price fetching.

Requests Library: To make HTTP requests to the financial API.

📈 How It Works:

The user adds stocks to the portfolio by entering the stock symbol, the number of shares they own, and the price they bought it at.

The tool fetches the latest stock prices using the API.

It calculates the performance, showing whether the stock’s value has gone up or down, and provides an overall view of the portfolio’s current value versus the initial investment.

Users can remove stocks from their portfolios when they no longer hold them.

🔧 Potential Improvements:

Error Handling: Add more robust error handling for invalid stock symbols or network issues.



🌟 Key Takeaways:

This project gave me hands-on experience working with financial APIs and real-time data handling.

It’s a great tool for automating stock portfolio tracking, and it can easily be extended to provide deeper financial insights.

Building this stock portfolio tracker was an exciting journey into financial technology and real-time data processing, combining Python with external APIs. Looking forward to enhancing it further and exploring more features!
